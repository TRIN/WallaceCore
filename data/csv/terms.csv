The male is winged but otherwise markedly different from the winged female of the same species in some of the following respects; body smaller and slenderer, color darker, head smaller; eyes larger; mandibles smaller; antennal scape shorter; antennal funiculi longer and finer; genitalia more conspicuous.

Often the gaster is conspicuously elevated; this doubtless has a cooling function. The nest entrance is closed at night and in the heat of the day with sand or pebbles.<br/>Michener (1942) reported the typical routine on a hot clear day at Pasadena: Opening of the nest entrance begins at 6:45 AM. At about 8:30 foraging begins: the workers deploy in all directions; they never form processions following trails. Orientation is by visual memory of the topography. By 10:30 the surface temperature is 129 F and foraging ceases. At 133 [F] workers forced out of the nest run at tremendous speed, climb pebbles or sticks, descend, climb again. If held at ground level they die in less than half a minute. By 2:30 at 115 0 foraging is resumed. At 4:40 the closing of the entrance begins and is completed by 6:30. The many workers who are left outside cluster near the entrance or climb plants for the night.<br/>Erickson (1972) reported the average number of workers per colony as about 4500.

","None","","AntsDC","","Knowledge","2","","P. californicus nests by preference in open areas in sandy or fine-gravelly soils (Fig. 16). Usually the nests are on level or nearly level ground, but among sand dunes they are located on steep slopes at the border of stabilizing vegetation.<br/>The underground nest is surmounted on the surface by a low flattened circular crater of loose sand 10-24 inches in diameter and 1-2 inches high. Near the center is a single entrance about &#190; inch in diameter. Frequently the excavated sand is blown away, leaving a hole in the ground as the only evidence of a nest.<br/>The workers make no attempt to clear away the vegetation around the nest.<br/>The nest of an incipient or young colony is usually located on a moderate slope (Fig.17).<br/>The mound is semicircular (often described as ""semilunar,"" ""crescentic"" or ""fan-like""), with a level surface which is situated just below the entrance; the latter is at the geometric center of the hypothetically completed circle. The radius is typically 4 inches. The entrance is a horizontal elliptical slit &#189; inch across. The entrance-tunnel descends obliquely into the earth. These mounds and entrances are strongly reminiscent of the entrances and tailings of abandoned gold and silver mines on the hillsides near Tonopah and Goldfield in evada.<br/>As the colony grows the mound tends to become a circular crater. On the steep slopes of sand dunes a flourishing colony may have mounds and entrances like those described above for young colonies, but the mounds will be much larger and there will be many mounds and entrances, always with the mound spread out down-slope below the entrance.<br/>We have found many chambers at a depth of one inch or less under an area of 1-2 square feet; these usually contained seeds or chaff. In a flourishing colony we found brood, seeds and sexuals in the same chamber, with the brood lying on the seeds. We have also found stored seeds at a depth of 5 inches.<br/>In the Desert Biome the following seeds were found in chambers in nests: Cercidium floridum, Cryptantha sp., Encelia sp., Euphorbia micromera.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1283316032","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790034","6","AntsDC","19af9e85e475d6bc47f1ec64c8368c01"

It consumes a wide variety of foods including grains, seeds, arthropods, and decaying matter, including vertebrate corpses. They have been reported to attack and dismember invertebrates such as small isopods, myriapods, molluscs, arachnids, land crabs, earthworms and insects.[10]<br/>Like all ants, A. gracilipes requires a protein-rich food source for the queen to lay eggs and carbohydrates as energy for the workers. They get their carbohydrates from plant nectar and honeydew producing insects, especially scale insects, aphids, and other Sternorrhyncha. Studies indicate that crazy ants rely so much on the scale insects that scarcity of them can actually limit ant population growth.[8]","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1276223078","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790037","5","Ants","e92dc28c2903597de8dd15fa5a371406"

It has been introduced into a wide range of tropical and subtropical environments including Caribbean islands, some Indian Ocean islands (Seychelles, Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion, the Cocos Islands and the Christmas Islands) and some Pacific islands (New Caledonia, Hawaii, French Polynesia, Okinawa, Vanuatu, Micronesia and the Galapagos archipelago)[8][9] The species has been known to occupy agricultural systems such as cinnamon, citrus, coffee and coconut plantations. Because the ant has generalized nesting habits, they are able to disperse via trucks, boats and other forms of human transport.[2]<br/>Crazy ant colonies naturally disperse through ""budding"", i.e. when mated queens and workers leave the nest to establish a new one, and only rarely through flight via female winged reproductive forms. Generally, colonies that disperse through ""budding"" have a lower rate of dispersal and need human intervention to reach distant areas. It has been recorded that A. gracilipes moves at about 37&#8211;400 meters a year in Seychelles.[8] A survey on Christmas Island, however, yielded an average spreading speed of three meters a day, the equivalent of one kilometre a year.[10]","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1276222426","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790037","4","Ants","0042db542359625077e820ea76b3f93a"

The ants protect the insects by 'nannying' the mobile crawler stages and protecting them against their natural enemies.[4] It is sometimes said that the ants are 'farming'; the scale insects.<br/>Recent experiments have shown that this connection is so strong that, in environments where A. gracilipes was removed, the density of scale insects dropped by 67% within 11 weeks, and to zero after 12 months.[11]","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1276222494","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790042","5","Ants","66a242722e89cb3cfdf8322aff5be3cd"

Literally meaning, ""one colony"", unicolonial behaviour is characterized by the cooperation and lack of aggressive behaviour between the foraging ants of multiple colonies, each with their own queen. The lack of competition between colonies gives the ants a competitive edge, and enables them to reach unusually high densities. Densities of up to 2,254 foraging ants per m2 with a biomass of 1.85 g per m2, and densities reached 10.5 nests entrances per m2. This represents the highest density of foraging ants ever recorded. [3]<br/>Furthermore, this multi-nest (polydomous) and multi-queen (polygynous) structure increases the probability of colony survival. Nests can contain up to 300 queens and 2,500-3,600 workers over areas as large as 150 hectares. [4]<br/>Although introduced to Christmas Island between 1915 and 1934, the first supercolony was discovered in 1989, and after 1996 supercolonies have been forming rapidly. By September 2002, 28% of the 10,000 hectares of rainforest on the island were infested. ( [5] in [3])<br/>Three different mechanisms contribute to maintaining the unusually high numbers of yellow crazy ants on Christmas Island. The enemy release hypothesis, suggests that lack of pressure from co-evolved natural enemies may allow organisms to achieve a large colonial size. [6] Another hypothesis relies on the fact that reduced intracolony aggression enables foraging ants to use the energy allocated to colony defense on expanding their colony. [7]<br/>Finally, the superior efficiency compared to native species at exploiting a diverse array of resources enables the ants to maintain a high foraging rate and thus increase in numbers.[8]","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1276222324","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790043","6","Ants","d12a743bdfb39f7c2d0cb9d89a14ab1c"

The ants then spend considerable time tending the caterpillars, 'milking' them for honeydew by stroking them gently with their antennae.  In return, the caterpillars gain protection as the ants attack the predators and parasites that would otherwise attack them.  In some cases these caterpillars get an additional advantage by gaining entry into the ant's nest where they feed on the ants' larvae!

The anterior portion of the mesonotal dorsum, back to the propodeum, is gently concave in profile. The propodeal dorsum is convex in profile. The petiole is thick, with an inverted-U-shaped crest.[1] Although they cannot sting, the ants spray formic acid in defence and, while this in itself does not kill the target, it can cause blindness and lead to death by starvation in many vertebrate victims.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1276222381","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790043","7","Ants","e616f92093633b020ad2fb26cd5a1c37"

The narrow-leafed form of this plant is considered be some to be a different species (<em>A.  sessiliceps</em>), however I am treating them as one and the same. Occurring more or less throughout the area although more common in the south, this shrub is often found on limestone or near salt lakes. Seeds are usually produced in autumn.

"TaxonProfile/Definitions.Dryandra_RelatedOrConfusingSpecies","Related or confusing species","","","","basis for separation (e. habit and leaves.) hybridisation,","Dryandra","","Identification","1","","Dryandra lindleyana belongs to the Series Niveae, a group of seven species which are very close taxonomically and are often difficult to separate in the field because of grading together of species and apparent hybridisation between them. They show remarkable uniformity of flower and seed morphology and are mostly separated on the basis of habit and leaves. In the past, some taxa now placed in lindleyana were referred to as forms of D. nivea while other taxa and D. brownii have been confused with D. arctotidis; D. brownii has also been confused with D. nivea. Only D. brownii and D. nivea lack a lignotuber and are killed by fire. This is a major means of separating these two species from the various lindleyana taxa all of which possess a lignotuber. Except for the small upright subsp. lindleyana var. mellicula, all the lindleyana taxa are prostrate plants; D. nivea and D. brownii are upright to around one metre. Subspecies media has similar blue-green leaves and the prostrate habit of D. cypholoba but its leaves are stiff (soft in D. cypholoba) and leaf lobes are flat, rather than recurved and hump-like as in D. cypholoba.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1277433473","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790088","4","Dryandra","a3ccc76fe3da4ced9d19637ef9fcf0fb"

These plants have shown considerable difficulty in dealing even with Brisbane winters which are mild by comparison with more temperate regions. During this season, leaves often drop or discolour with fungal spots. From its natural habitat, it can be assumed that a hot, tropical, frost-free climate is a prerequisite for successful cultivation, although it may be more adaptable than expected. It is probably drought-resistant. For growing this species on its own roots, a sunny, open position in sandy, well-drained soil should give success. In its natural habitat, its roots penetrate deeply into small cracks of normally vertical rock faces, hence specially built rockeries may be required.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1289962034","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790185","2","Grevillea","e37113c043438c1e704b42b121ce50f6"

Flowers autumn-spring. Pollinated by nectarivorous birds, possibly also by bats or small mammals. Regenerates from seed or lignotuber, occasionally from sucker. After low-intensity fire, shoots arise from epicormic buds on the trunk and branches. Plants will send up new vegetative growth from underground roots or lignotubers up to 2 years after the main plant or stem has been broken off. Cockatoos have been observed feeding on the seed. Emus have been observed eating the flowers 'to produce good eggs' (Maningrida). This is an important plant to the ecology of its natural occurrence where it provides abundant nectar to wildlife over a long period.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1289962927","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790185","2","Grevillea","b060c7a872188874934e2de485344bc3"

Large one-sided, golden-orange conflorescences are produced prolifically, often arising in the same axil as a previous conflorescence. The flowers are bright and attractive and the plants make excellent specimen or screen plants. The prostrate form, sometimes sold as G. 'Mandarin Mantle', makes a spectacular ground cover. In all forms, nectar-flow is so prolific that it is often observed dripping to the ground, especially around the middle of the day.

"TaxonProfile/Definitions.Grevillea_Variation","Variation","","Variation","","","Grevillea","","Identification","1","","A wide-ranging species with a number of interesting forms. A full study of the variation in this species remains to be completed.<br/>Typical form This form is found mainly in Qld and is usually a non-lignotuberous, robust shrub or small tree with ± smooth bark and a relatively narrow main trunk (cf. the Northern tree form). The revolute leaf margins usually enclose the lower surface and the leaf lobes are mostly < 3 mm wide. The style is relatively narrow (c. 0.5 mm thick) and the nectary obscure. Collections with these features also occur in the N.T. and on offshore islands. It is often branched almost to the ground. Flower colour is paler than for the Northern tree form.<br/>Prostrate form Known from headlands around Cooktown and exposed areas near Cape Flattery, this form is procumbent with branches spreading to 5m. This unusual habit reproduces true from seed.<br/>Northern tree form This form first develops a thickening of the basal stem into a corky-barked lignotuber, with relatively slow development of the main stem and upper canopy. For many years, it grows as an open, single-stemmed shrub up 10-15 m high, reverting to regrowth from the lignotuber after fire. With age, the stem develops a relatively thick, corky protective layer, capable of resprouting from epicormic buds along the trunk and even branchlets. Typically it has coarse leaf lobes (up to 10 mm wide) but narrow-leaf forms also occur. The style is relatively stout (often up to 1.5 mm wide), deep orange, and the nectary quite prominent. It occurs in lowland woodland in a wide arc across the northern part of the N.T. and W.A.<br/>Silver-leaf form Occurs in the Birdulba area of Kakadu NP and possibly elsewhere and is distinguished by a persistent indumentum on the leaf upper surface. It otherwise has the features of the Northern tree form. Resprouting leaves and young seedling leaves are glabrous.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1289962648","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790187","2","Grevillea","b8295ee43a9d566ed5dd126caa583bb0"

Scientists in the Netherlands have used this information to demonstrate how cabbage whitefly can be used to improve biological control of greenhouse whitefly on greenhouse cucumbers. They established some plants of nipplewort (_Lapsana communis- L. (Asteraceae)) and greater celandine (_Chelidonium majus_ L. (Papaveraceae)) in the cucumber greenhouse and colonised these plants with cabbage whiteflies. The whitefly parasitoid, _Encarsia formosa_ Gahan, 1924 (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), was released into the greenhouse to attack the greenhouse whitefly on the cucumbers. Some also established a breeding colony using the cabbage whiteflies as hosts. Adult parasitoids that hatched from the cabbage whitefly could spread to the cucumber plants and attack the greenhouse whitefly. The nipplewort and greater celandine plants with cabbage whitefly are called &#8216;banker plants&#8217;. They provide a reservoir of a natural enemy that can help to control a pest in a crop by providing a continuously breeding source of the beneficial organism.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1297134912","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790211","2","NZAC","cabfbd87d99d27d773e8919f28034bfd"

Cabbage whiteflies can sometimes reach high numbers on vegetable brassicas. It is often difficult to control whitefly by using insecticides alone.<br/>Non-insecticide controls include:<br/>Removing weed host plants and other less important plants that are hosts of cabbage whitefly; this reduces the inoculum and source of adults to infest the crop plants,<br/>Having a break in the year from growing the plants on which cabbage whitefly multiplies well,<br/>Removing leaves with large numbers of juvenile whitefly and burying or composting the leaves so that adults do not emerge,<br/>Spraying the underside of leaves with soapy water to kill adult whiteflies.<br/>Most insecticides will kill only adult or very young larvae of the cabbage whitefly. Eggs, older larvae and puparia are resistant to most insecticides. This means that a single application of most insecticides will not give adequate control of whitefly. Usually a sequence of applications is required to kill emerging adults before they lay many eggs, and to kill the young larvae when they hatch from eggs and before they grow and moult into larger larvae.<br/>If insecticide sprays are used, they should be directed onto the undersides of leaves. In addition, chemicals that cause least harm to natural enemies should be selected.<br/>More information about controlling whitefly can be found at www.nzpps.org/resistance/whitefly.php","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1297134509","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790212","3","NZAC","88469a49ab56d9adb8eac94b0a5a370b"

It also lives on crop plants (brassicas), garden flowers (a blue and white species of _Aquilegia_ (Ranunculaceae)) and &#8216;weeds&#8217; such as sow thistle, _Sonchus oleraceus_, also known as puha. In other countries, the cabbage whitefly breeds on other plants in the daisy family (Asteraceae) and on plants in other families such as broad beans (Fabaceae) and poppies (Papaveraceae).<br/>Adult and juvenile whiteflies feed by inserting their stylets into the phloem, the nutrient transport vessels of the plant. The whiteflies suck the plant sap and feeding by large numbers of them can debilitate the plant. Plant sap is high in sugars and low in other nutrients. Whiteflies excrete the excess sugary liquid, which is called honey-dew. This makes the plant leaves sticky. Sometimes black &#8217;sooty mould&#8217; fungi grow on the sticky surfaces.<br/>*Table: Host plants of cabbage whitefly, Aleyrodes proletella (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) from Plant-SyNZ database (December 2009).

The leaf blade is 1-1.8 m across on a stout erect or curved stalk to 3 m long. The leaf stalks are flattened above and convex below, dull dark green, often with white scurf below, about 2 cm diameter at the tip and 6 cm across at the base where they become concave above and partially sheath the trunk. The sheathing bases consist of mats of fibres wrapped around the trunk with a pale, parchment-like tongue hanging down on the side opposite the leaf stalk. Younger vigorously growing specimens are armed with short, pale green, mostly downward-pointing spines along the margins of the lower half of the leaf stalk. The leaf blades are broadly circular in outline, pleated and divided about two-thirds the way down into 30-50 narrow, pointed segments with slender, entire or forked, drooping tips. The segments are thin-textured and fairly stiff, with a prominent central vein, raised below, and 6-7 longitudinal veins.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1289961234","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790250","2","Palm","0b1330294c4bf2db052d619f766edb31"

Effective management of insect pests before harvest is essential, especially within the 4 weeks before harvest. Use preharvest insecticide sprays to reduce the pest population at harvest. Postharvest disinfestation dips are not recommended. If necessary (e.g. for export), treat flowers with a registered insecticide fumigant with stems in water.<br/>Ethylene sensitivity and antiethylene treatment: 'Lipstick' is sensitive to ethylene, and anti-ethylene treatment is recommended. Signs of ethylene damage include flower wilting and drop and leaf drop. See 'Anti-ethylene treatment' opposite. Other boronias may also be sensitive to ethylene, and trials of antiethylene treatment are recommended. However, B. muelleri 'Sunset Serenade' and B. clavata are not ethylene sensitive.<br/>Drying out:  Wilted bunches can be revived by putting the whole stem under water for 2-3 hours. Bunches can also be misted to keep them from drying out.

Several cultivars and hybrids are available with superior flower features and an extended colour range, from white and lemon, pale to hot pink, to deep blackish purple ('Purple Jared'). Both flowers and foliage are aromatic. Indeed, Boronia megastigma (brown boronia), grown for its unusual brown flowers, is an important source of essential oils. &#8216;Lipstick&#8217; has slightly scented, vibrant pink, bellshaped flowers 8&#8211;10 mm long, held on short pendulous stalks.<br/>Boronia has a long history in cultivation as an ornamental plant: B. megastigma was introduced into Britain in the 1840s; and bush-picked boronia has sold since the 1800s.

The preferred option is:<br/>* Cool, process, cool &#8211; for example, remove field heat by cooling flowers immediately by placing in a cool room at 2-4 &deg;C in buckets of postharvest solution, process flowers (bunch, grade), and then cool to 2-4 &deg;C by either forced-air cooling (if boxed) or holding overnight in a cool room.<br/>* Forced-air cooling of packed flowers is ideal for large volumes of product.<br/>Temperature and humidity: Hold in a high-humidity cool room (95%) at 2&#8211;4 &deg;C for up to 2 days, but preferably much less.<br/>Disinfestation (see 'Common postharvest problems' below): Do this before a long (overnight) anti-ethylene pulse or after a short pulse (room temperature). <br/>Anti-ethylene treatment: 'Lipstick' and other B. heterophylla selections are ethylene sensitive. There are two alternative anti-ethylene treatments:<br/>1. Use a commercial anti-ethylene silver solution, e.g. Chrysal AVB, as these have been shown to increase vase life (for more details, refer to Postharvest Manual*). Treat bunches according to the product label (concentration, temperature and duration of treatment). Uptake may be less effective if flowers are poorly hydrated before pulsing. Do your own trials to optimise the procedure: overpulsing can have adverse effects (e.g. rapid closing and shrivelling of flowers).<br/>1. Alternatively, you can add EthylBloc sachets to cartons when the flowers are packed (see 'Packaging' below).<br/>Postharvest solutions: *Postharvest solution:* After a short anti-ethylene treatment, transfer flowers to clean water, preferably with added registered biocide or a reputable commercial postharvest solution, and cool to 2-4 &deg;C. Hold in solution for 8-16 hours before marketing. *Holding solution:* Same as the postharvest solution.<br/>Longer-term storage: Boronia does not tolerate long-term storage.

It differs from Arachnorchis australis which has larger osmophores on the lateral sepals (10-20mm) and more numerous marginal teeth on the labellum.<br/>A hirsute, terrestrial herb growing singly or in small loose groups. Leaf linear-lanceolate, 8-10 cm long, 0.6 cm wide, dull green, base purple-blotched;. Flower 1, 4-5 cm diam., pale yellow with some fine reddish striae; tepaline caudae dark red; labellum base pale yellow, apex dark red to maroon; calli dark red; column translucent, with red markings. Sepaline caudae with short thick osmophores densely packed with dark red, globose glands; dorsal sepal erect; lateral sepals widely divergent, stiffly decurved; petals spreading to stiffly deflexed.<br/>Characterised by relatively small pale yellow flowers with reddish striae, stiffly held lateral sepals and petals, a relatively large, thick, prominent, dark red osmophore on the dorsal sepal, tiny dark red osmophores on the lateral sepals and, mid section of the labellum margins with a few short serrate teeth. This species is most similar to A. australis (G.W.Carr) D.L.Jones & M.A.Clem., which has longer osmophores on all the sepals and more numerous, longer, linear marginal teeth on the labellum. It also has similarities with A. valida (Nicholls) D.L.Jones & M.A.Clem. which has cream to white flowers, labellum base white with red veins, a maroon apex and numerous marginal teeth.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1283485028","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790281","4","SPRAT","370b1249f9080cc60cdc90b01965dc8f"

It appears to have a very restricted distribution and has not been located at any sites other than the type locality despite sporadic searches over a period of 20 years and more intensive surveys over the last four years.<br/>The exact location of the type locality has been kept obscure to protect the species from illegal collection and trampling by orchid enthusiasts.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1283485388","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790281","4","SPRAT","d4754b4afe60945dd1a3f966019d9fe6"

On the rear of the body and on the tail, the black gradually encroaches upon the lighter color, so that in some specimens these parts are black with light crossbands. The head is colored like the body with many of the scales edged in black. The throat is nearly always yellow or orange-yellow with variable black markings. Young king cobras, more vividly marked than the parents, possess a contrasting pattern of many narrow white or yellow crossbands on a black or dark brown body color. Occasionally, each scale between the bands is light centered. Four white lines cross the head of young snakes, one over the snout, another in front of the eye, one behind the eye, and the last one over the back of the head.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1277086922","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790313","4","Snake","8396532aec52e8adc42c0afade190a89"

It has been described as ferocious and aggressive, and several accounts tell in detail of capricious attacks made by this snake upon human beings. However, in spite of its bad reputation, the king cobra, when disturbed by man, generally makes every possible effort to avoid an encounter, sometimes even while at the nest.<br/>A classic example of such behavior was reported in Vol. 39 of the Journal of the Bombay Natural History Society. In this case, fourteen people in a picnic party, and their seven dogs, twice passed within 2 yd of a king cobra nest without creating any visible response from the snake. When a stick was poked into the nest, the snake merely thrust out its head momentarily from the pile of leaves to investigate. A somewhat similar report is made by Evans (1921), who several times closely approached an adult king cobra which had been flushed from hiding by a pack of dogs. The snake in this instance was given every reason to make an attack, having been provoked repeatedly, yet time and again it sought only to escape its tormentors. Tweedie describes the recent case of a forest worker who unwittingly stood on a king cobra's tail while inspecting a rubber tree. Hearing a hissing sound nearby, the man looked around, only to find that he was standing on the snake's tail. When he lifted his foot, the cobra crawled away, but immediately the man's dog brought the snake to bay. It is significant that with all of this provocation the reptile completely failed to take the initiative and attack. Naturalists familiar with the king cobra agree that while this snake is potentially very dangerous, and although it may on rare occasions make an apparently unprovoked attack upon a human being, such attacks are exceptional and can usually be attributed to the snake's desire to protect its nest. We are so accustomed to seeing photos of cobras with their hoods spread that many people do not realize that normally a cobra looks like any other snake. It is only when startled or annoyed that a cobra rears the forepart of its body and, by raising the unusually long forward ribs, distends the skin to form the hood. Because of its great length, a king cobra can rear up until its head is level with a man's chest, but its hood is relatively narrower than that of other cobras.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1277087881","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790314","4","Snake","a57ef9956c2df99a05147c8c744c5638"

Throughout Malaya, where the snake is common, it is frequently encountered on estates bordering the jungle. On one occasion, a large specimen was discovered on the Island Golf Course in Singapore, where evidently it had spent most of its life undetected. Despite its large size, it sometimes climbs trees.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1277087351","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790315","4","Snake","7dc23c8e87bf8c8b35b7456b6d1e8461"

The nest, which looks much like a pile of dead leaves, may contain from twenty to forty eggs. It is carefully guarded by the female, sometimes with the help of the male. When hatched, the young snakes measure about 20 or 21 in. in length, according to Wall (1924).","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1277095319","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790317","4","Snake","6dee605c2da77a4d933e593f5196e141"

"TaxonProfile/Definitions.TTI_CollectionAndHandlingOfPropagatingMaterial","Collection and handling of propagating material","","","","","TTI","","Unplaced","","","*Root shoots*<br/>The use of root shoots to propagate breadfruit is the traditional method in the Pacific, and some varieties, such as 'Puou', produce numerous root shoots. Collect healthy shoots when they are at least 20&#8211;25 cm (8&#8211;10 in) tall and the stem has become woody and is producing lobed leaves. Shoots up to 1 m (3.3 ft) tall can be used. Remove by cutting the attached root 10&#8211;15 cm (4&#8211;6 in) on either side of the shoot and carefully lifting out the shoot and any attached root system. Use a sharp machete or clippers to sever the shoot from the parent tree and to facilitate wound healing. It is difficult to avoid damaging the shoot&#8217;s root system when the shoot is removed, so root shoots need to be grown under nursery conditions before outplanting. The success rate of directly transplanting shoots to another location is low, around 25%. Trim off the leaves and cut the tip at a 45 degree angle at a height of 15-30 cm (6-12 in; see photo). Trimming the tip makes the root shoot more manageable, and the apical shoot tends to die back anyway. Plant in organic, well drained media in a 1-2 gallon (10-20 cm) pot. Keep shaded (up to 60% shade) and moist, but not wet, and misting is recommended. It should never be allowed to dry out. Depending on the size of the shoot, it will need to be grown under nursery conditions for 3-6 months before outplanting. The percentage of successful rooting and shoot growth ranges from 50 to 90%.<br/>*Root cuttings* Root shoots are not always available from a desired variety, and root cuttings can be used to mass-propagate breadfruit. Collect roots from healthy, vigorous trees. Carefully excavate roots that are growing just beneath the surface of the soil. Do not use surface roots because these tend to dry out and have a lower success rate. Look for roots with small rounded bumps on the surface-these adventitious buds will develop into new shoots. Roots 1.5-6 cm (0.6-2.4 in) in diameter can be used, and 3-4 cm (1.4-1.8 in) is suggested for best results. Removing roots larger than 6 cm (2.4 in) can be detrimental to the tree, damaging the root system, and because the wounded area will heal more slowly. Use a sharp machete or clippers to sever the root and facilitate wound healing. The remaining attached root will often develop a root shoot at the cut end. Cut roots into 15-25 cm (6-10 in) sections. It is best to wash and scrub the roots to remove soil. Discard any pieces that are damaged or misshapen. Treatment with fungicide is recommended to prevent growth of pathogens that cause root rots. Hormone treatment is not required but standard hormone mixes can be used according to the manufacturers recommendation. Place the roots in a propagating bed, flats, or individual pots. Space roots 10-15 cm (4-6 in) in a row and 15-20 cm (6-8 in) between rows in beds or flats. Use well drained potting media or clean, washed silica sand. Do not use beach sand because it is too saline and alkaline. Cuttings are placed either horizontal (covered with media) or at an angle, but not upright, with a small upper portion of the root exposed. Root cuttings should be kept shaded (up to 60% shade) and moist, but not wet; misting is recommended. The roots should never be allowed to dry out. The percentage of rooting ranges from 75 to 85%. Shoots begin to develop from adventitious buds after 3-4 weeks. When shoots are 20-25 cm (8&#8211;10 in) tall with their own root system&#8212;usually in 4-6 months carefully uproot and transplant into 2-3 gallon (20-30 cm) pots. Use a well drained medium. If adding fertilizer (such as balanced 8-8-8) use only sparingly, less than half the manufacturers' recommendations. Keep plants in partial shade and weed-free. Grow to a size of 0.6-1.6 m (24-64 in) in 6-9 months.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1296801067","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790368","2","TTI","214599073bc589a6a7c5fac2811edc30"

Because of their large surface area it is best to reduce the size of the leaves to reduce transpiration. Carefully remove 1/2 to 2/3 of the lower leaves. Do not remove or damage the growing point of the plant where new leaves develop. Protect from wind and excessive heat during transport. Dig a hole the same depth of the container and twice as wide as the container. Add a small amount of fertilizer, such as 8-8-8 slow-release fertilizer, to the bottom of the hole and cover with soil. To prevent injury to the delicate root system, carefully cut off the container rather than pulling the plant out. Place the breadfruit tree in the hole, add soil no higher than the level of the plant in the pot, top-dress with compost, and water well. Close to 100% success rate can be expected.<br/>Young plants prefer partial shade. It is best to plant at the onset of the rainy season, but if the weather is dry, irrigate for the first 1-3 months of establishment. Once established, breadfruit trees can withstand a dry season of 3-4 months, although it prefers moist conditions. Mulching young plants is beneficial by helping keep the soil moist and adding a steady supply of nutrients. It also helps control weeds around the root system. Use of herbicides to control weeds around the base of the tree can damage the tree if it comes in contact with the surface roots or young trunk.

Use a sharp knife and be careful not to cut into the wood. Rooting hormone is not required but if used, follow the manufacturer's recommendations. Wrap moistened sphagnum moss, or other organic media, around this area and hold it in place with a piece of plastic, aluminum foil, burlap, or copra bag tied around the branch. Up to 50% of air-layers will not root but instead form a ring of hardened callus along the end of the cut. Also, the branches are brittle and may snap off in high winds. They can be braced with bamboo splints placed over the wrapped air-layer. After 2-4 months, new roots will develop and grow through the medium. Remove the air-layer by cutting the branch directly below the roots. Place in a 1-2 gallon (10-20 cm) pot in a well drained medium until the plant has an established root system (about a year). The tip of the branch often dies and the air-layer will fail to take unless a new shoot develops from buds lower on the branch.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1297032467","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790381","2","TTI_Propagation","5375897a46abbe861d1199dd40bf17f7"

","","","TTI","","Knowledge","1","","Root shoots are not always available from a desired variety, and root cuttings can be used to mass-propagate breadfruit. Collect roots from healthy, vigorous trees. Carefully excavate roots that are growing just beneath the surface of the soil. Do not use surface roots because these tend to dry out and have a lower success rate. Look for roots with small rounded bumps on the surface these adventitious buds will develop into new shoots. Roots 1.5-6 cm (0.6-2.4 in) in diameter can be used, and 3-4 cm (1.4-1.8 in) is suggested for best results. Removing roots larger than 6 cm (2.4 in) can be detrimental to the tree, damaging the root system, and because the wounded area will heal more slowly. Use a sharp machete or clippers to sever the root and facilitate wound healing. The remaining attached root will often develop a root shoot at the cut end.<br/>Cut roots into 15-25 cm (6-10 in) sections. It is best to wash and scrub the roots to remove soil. Discard any pieces that are damaged or misshapen. Treatment with fungicide is recommended to prevent growth of pathogens that cause root rots. Hormone treatment is not required but standard hormone mixes can be used according to the manufacturers recommendation. Place the roots in a propagating bed, flats, or individual pots. Space roots 10-15 cm (4-6 in) in a row and 15-20 cm (6-8 in) between rows in beds or flats. Use well drained potting media or clean, washed silica sand. Do not use beach sand because it is too saline and alkaline. Cuttings are placed either horizontal (covered with media) or at an angle, but not upright, with a small upper portion of the root exposed.<br/>Root cuttings should be kept shaded (up to 60% shade) and moist, but not wet; misting is recommended. The roots should never be allowed to dry out. The percentage of rooting ranges from 75 to 85%. Shoots begin to develop from adventitious buds after 3-4 weeks. When shoots are 20-25 cm (8-10 in) tall with their own root system&#8212;usually in 4-6 months-carefully uproot and transplant into 2-3 gallon (20-30 cm) pots. Use a well drained medium. If adding fertilizer (such as balanced 8-8-8) use only sparingly, less than half the manufacturers&#8217; recommendations. Keep plants in partial shade and weed-free. Grow to a size of 0.6&#8211;1.6 m (24-64 in) in 6-9 months.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1297031984","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790382","2","TTI_Propagation","89761b07462e39afd2729a064fbc5770"

It has a spreading habit and small heads of flowers covering the plant from mid-summer until late autumn. Only the best colour forms should be selected for cultivation. This species has been grown under both winter- and summer rainfall conditions for several years, in light sandy and gravelly soils, in positions with full sun and light overhead shade. It has not been successfully grown in heavy soils. Reports suggest it may have been cultivated in eastern Australia for much longer under the name of V minutiflora. When planted in the conditions mentioned, the species has proved easy to grow, hardy and tenacious, tolerant of moderate frosts and relatively free from insect and fungal attack. Plants require only light pruning, by shearing off old flowers, to promote fresh new growth. When spent flowers are not removed, the plants tend to hold them for a considerable period of extended dormancy, limiting flowering to alternate years. Flowering stems can be used for posies and small floral arrangements and the flowers dry well, maintaining colour for many weeks. However, the nectar has a slight odour that particularly sensitive noses may not appreciate.<br/>V. vicinella shows potential as a novelty shrub in small gardens, rockeries and containers for its summer-autumn blooming. Group plantings of different forms, inter-planted with V. minutiflora and V. fastigiata or similar small shrubs, could add interesting colour and texture for small areas. This kind of planting could be used as an ornamental small border planted in front of larger shrubs, especially if winter and spring flowering species are included to produce continuous colour.<br/>Propagation is from soft to semi-hardwood cuttings taken from fresh growth. These strike readily and the rooted cuttings are relatively easy to grow on to establishment in the garden. Seed viability has not been recorded and propagation by means of grafting or tissue culture has not been attempted.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1277436133","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790389","3","Vert","1bc2130a0e6a25a8eb6efc4695d05e83"

It has a spreading habit and small heads of flowers covering the plant from midsummer until late autumn. Only the best colour forms should be selected for cultivation. This species has been grown under both winter-and summer rainfall conditions for several years, in light sandy and gravelly soils, in positions with full sun and light overhead shade. It has not been successfully grown in heavy soils. Reports suggest it may have been cultivated in eastern Australia for much longer under the name of _V. minutiflora_. When planted in the conditions mentioned, the species has proved easy to grow, hardy and tenacious, tolerant of moderate frosts and relatively free from insect and fungal attack. Plants require only light pruning, by shearing off old flowers, to promote fresh new growth. When spent flowers are not removed, the plants tend to hold them for a considerable period of extended dormancy, limiting flowering to alternate years. Flowering stems can be used for posies and small floral arrangements and the flowers dry well, maintaining colour for many weeks. However, the nectar has a slight odour that particularly sensitive noses may not appreciate.<br/>V vicinella shows potential as a novelty shrub in small gardens, rockeries and containers for its summer-autumn blooming. Group plantings of different forms, inter-planted with V. minutiflora and V. fastigiata or similar small shrubs, could add interesting colour and texture for small areas. This kind of planting could be used as an ornamental small border planted in front of larger shrubs, especially if winter and spring flowering species are included to produce continuous colour.\r\nPropagation is from soft to semi-hardwood cuttings taken from fresh growth. These strike readily and the rooted cuttings are relatively easy to grow on to establishment in the garden. Seed viability has not been recorded and propagation by means of grafting or tissue culture has not been attempted.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1287467425","BaseUserMapping_666","1308719563","8","WC_Husbandry","c343665372cd210415f23e9402185174"

Initial seedling growth is slow until the roots become established, after which close stems intertwine and begin to form thickets. Flowering does not usually commence until early in the following summer and then continues until March or April (!CRC 2003).\r\nHowever, Lantana flowers whenever the soil is moist and the air is warm and humid. For much of its range along the Queensland and New South Wales coasts, this results in almost continuous flowering and fruiting. Further inland, peak flowering occurs several weeks after soaking rain (25 mm or more) and is usually accompanied by good fruit set (!CRC 2003).","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1290395857","BaseUserMapping_666","1309120703","4","WC_Phenology","bba6e86d43a5f9526ae5abcba4f794ce"

It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. Lantana forms dense, impenetrable thickets that take over native bushland and pastures on the east coast of Australia. It competes for resources with, and reduces the productivity of, pastures and forestry plantations. It adds fuel to fires, and is toxic to stock (!CRC 2003).\r\nMost variants of L. camara in Australia are toxic to domestic livestock (sheep, cattle) to some degree, with only three thought to be consistently non-toxic. There does not appear to be any documentation of palatability and toxicity to native fauna. Toxicity seems likely to be related to genetic factors, not environmental ones. Some toxic reactions have been recorded in humans, especially children (!DECC 2007).<br/>Lantana dominance appears to adversely affect the species richness of soil fauna assemblages, such as ants, and decreases the diversity of soil fungi. It can also affect flora diversity by reducing seedling germination and by increasing the chance and severity of fire in plant communities such as dry rainforest. Lantana has been identified as a potential threat to many threatened and endangered plants and animals and a number of endangered ecological communities (!DECC 2007).","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1289188810","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790440","3","WC_Ecology","11a045d0bb11bb92ff92373e3d357e5e"

A range of methods including herbicides, mechanical removal, fire, biological control and revegetation should be used. Best results are obtained by working from areas of light infestation towards heavier infestation, and longterm follow-up control is required after initial attempts. Minimise both disturbance to land and excessive use of fire to retain vigorous native vegetation and reduce the opportunity for Lantana to become established (!CRC 2003).<br/>Lantana has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls.<br/>In 1902 the first attempt at biological control of a weed targeted Lantana in Hawaii. In Australia biological control agents were first introduced in 1914; so far 30 species have been introduced. Research into biological control is ongoing, and several agents are currently being examined for suitability of release (!CRC 2003). Of the 16 species that have established, four insects have had a major impact on Lantana: a sap-sucking bug (Teleonemia scrupulosa); two leaf-mining beetles (Uroplata girardi and Octotoma scabripennis); and a seed-feeding fly (Ophiomyia lantanae. The biological control agents vary in their effectiveness against the many different types of Lantana. For example, Lantana can drop its leaves when stressed, depriving some agents of their food (!CRC 2003). For more detailed information on the biocontrol species see information released by the Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Water (http://www.nrw.qld.gov.au/pests/news_publications/publications/lantana_bio_infosheets.html .) The combination of methods used will depend on the extent of the infestation, the landform on which it is found, and the time of year during which control is to be undertaken. Revegetation of treated sites is also important. For more information on Lantana control see !CRC 2003. Clark et al. (2006) provide detailed information on the use of herbicides to control Lantana. Van Oosterhout et al. (2004) provides comprehensive coverage of the current control options and information on planning a control strategy. See References, links and further resources. Please see the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority for chemical information http://www.apvma.gov.au . For further information see the Lantana Control Manual (available at http://www.weeds.org.au/WoNS/lantana/)","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1288755536","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790500","2","WC_Procedures","23b34744d026d4f8261f5e9a8162b789"

"TaxonProfile/Definitions.Weeds_Description","Description","","Morphological characteristics.","None","","Weeds","","Knowledge","2","","Lantana is a sprawling or scandent shrub or vine normally 1-3 m high, and on rare occassions to 6 m high in favourable conditions, often growing in dense thickets. The stems and branches are normally quadrangular in cross-section when young, often well armed with short recurved prickles and sometimes with glands or glandular hairs. The leaves are in opposite pairs on the stem, with successive pairs borne at right angles to each other. The leaves are ovate to oblong-ovate, about 4-10 cm long, 3-6 cm wide, often covered with rough coarse hairs on the upper surface and strongly aromatic due to glandular hairs. The margins are bluntly toothed. The inflorescence is a dense head of 20-40 brightly coloured flowers, ranging from yellow, orange-yellow, deep orange, deep red, pink, rose-pink to white, often with a variation of colours in each head of flowers and with the flowers having the ability to change colour as they mature. The fruit has many berries, which ripen from green to shiny purple-black and contain one or two pale seeds (!CRC 2003).\r\nLantana is an 'aggregate species', or 'species complex'. There are several natural variants of L. camara across its presumed native range in the tropical Americas, and in addition some hundreds of horticultural colour and habit varieties have been developed around the world, with over 650 varietal names coined (!DECC 2007).\r\nFor further information and assistance with identification of Lantana contact the herbarium in your state or territory.\r\nSeed longevity in the soil is not well documented, but seeds are thought to remain viable for several years under natural conditions. Work in progress suggests an in-soil longevity of at least three and up to five years. Germination rates are reported as being increased by removal of fruit pulp, as occurs with passage through the digestive system of birds and by warm temperatures, light, and high soil moisture. Germination rates even under favourable conditions are sometimes reported as fairly low (<45% or less), but as fruits may set at rates of up to several thousand /m2 there is a considerable soil seedbank (!CRC 2003; !DECC 2007).\r\nLantana can resprout from the base if the shoot dies, extending the life of individual plants (!CRC 2003).","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1278393097","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790513","4","Weeds","ea48905d2560c696e4160039bf6fb1f1"

Initial seedling growth is slow until the roots become established, after which close stems intertwine and begin to form thickets. Flowering does not usually commence until early in the following summer and then continues until March or April (!CRC 2003).\r\nHowever, Lantana flowers whenever the soil is moist and the air is warm and humid. For much of its range along the Queensland and New South Wales coasts, this results in almost continuous flowering and fruiting. Further inland, peak flowering occurs several weeks after soaking rain (25 mm or more) and is usually accompanied by good fruit set (!CRC 2003).","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1278399990","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790515","4","Weeds","bbd0fac3ed6d380cdde6e77ecce5be89"

"TaxonProfile/Definitions.Weeds_HowItSpreads","How it spreads","","Dispersal of seeds and propagation.","None","","Weeds","","Knowledge","2","","Lantana spreads in two ways. Layering is a form of vegetative reproduction where stems send roots into the soil, allowing it to quickly form very dense stands and spread short distances. Also, birds and other animals such as foxes consume and pass the seed in their droppings, potentially spreading it over quite large distances. The germination rate of fresh seed is generally low, but improves after being digested (!CRC 2003).\r\nButterflies, bees and other insects are attracted by the nectar and pollinate Lantana flowers. About half of the flowers produce seeds, typically 1-20 seeds on each flower head. Mature plants can produce up to 12 000 seeds every year. Seeds are thought to remain viable for several years under natural conditions (!CRC 2003).\r\nLantana is allelopathic and can release chemicals into the surrounding soil which prevent germination and competition from some other plant species (!CRC 2003).","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1278393263","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790516","4","Weeds","d9c67ce9100cdb004d7a9bef5da039cf"
"TaxonProfile/Definitions.Weeds_Impacts","Impacts","","The effect this taxon has on habitat once it is established.","None","","Weeds","","Notes","3","","Lantana is a Weed of National Significance. It is regarded as one of the worst weeds in Australia because of its invasiveness, potential for spread, and economic and environmental impacts. Lantana forms dense, impenetrable thickets that take over native bushland and pastures on the east coast of Australia. It competes for resources with, and reduces the productivity of, pastures and forestry plantations. It adds fuel to fires, and is toxic to stock (!CRC 2003).\r\nMost variants of L. camara in Australia are toxic to domestic livestock (sheep, cattle) to some degree, with only three thought to be consistently non-toxic. There does not appear to be any documentation of palatability and toxicity to native fauna. Toxicity seems likely to be related to genetic factors, not environmental ones. Some toxic reactions have been recorded in humans, especially children (!DECC 2007).\r\nLantana dominance appears to adversely affect the species richness of soil fauna assemblages, such as ants, and decreases the diversity of soil fungi. It can also affect flora diversity by reducing seedling germination and by increasing the chance and severity of fire in plant communities such as dry rainforest. Lantana has been identified as a potential threat to many threatened and endangered plants and animals and a number of endangered ecological communities (!DECC 2007).","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1278393446","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790516","3","Weeds","44a4c466f146591729389f2c384fb34f"

It typically invades disturbed land and river margins, extending its range in response to rainfall.   It threatens agriculture and pastoral production, forestry and biodiversity of conservation areas, and may be toxic to stock.   The highest priority for Lantana control is preventing its spread into northern Australia and west of the Great Dividing Range.   Integrated control should combine fire, mechanical, chemical and biological methods, and revegetation.","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1278393222","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790517","4","Weeds","8ce9507ce1167299c619b47f2d9fded2"

It is similar to Lantana camara but does not have thorns, has mainly purple flowers and trails along the ground, only growing to a height of half a metre. It is also toxic and readily displaces native vegetation (!CRC 2003).","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1278399825","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790519","5","Weeds","d22dd9e84823c7a4577f875d90d5976a"

A range of methods including herbicides, mechanical removal, fire, biological control and revegetation should be used. Best results are obtained by working from areas of light infestation towards heavier infestation, and longterm follow-up control is required after initial attempts. Minimise both disturbance to land and excessive use of fire to retain vigorous native vegetation and reduce the opportunity for Lantana to become established (!CRC 2003).<br/>Lantana has also been recognised as a target for biological control through a cross-jurisdictional government process. This allows activities to be undertaken to develop effective biological controls.<br/>In 1902 the first attempt at biological control of a weed targeted Lantana in Hawaii. In Australia biological control agents were first introduced in 1914; so far 30 species have been introduced. Research into biological control is ongoing, and several agents are currently being examined for suitability of release (!CRC 2003). Of the 16 species that have established, four insects have had a major impact on Lantana: a sap-sucking bug (Teleonemia scrupulosa); two leaf-mining beetles (Uroplata girardi and Octotoma scabripennis); and a seed-feeding fly (Ophiomyia lantanae. The biological control agents vary in their effectiveness against the many different types of Lantana. For example, Lantana can drop its leaves when stressed, depriving some agents of their food (!CRC 2003). For more detailed information on the biocontrol species see information released by the Queensland Department of Natural Resources and Water (http://www.nrw.qld.gov.au/pests/news_publications/publications/lantana_bio_infosheets.html .) The combination of methods used will depend on the extent of the infestation, the landform on which it is found, and the time of year during which control is to be undertaken. Revegetation of treated sites is also important. For more information on Lantana control see !CRC 2003. Clark et al. (2006) provide detailed information on the use of herbicides to control Lantana. Van Oosterhout et al. (2004) provides comprehensive coverage of the current control options and information on planning a control strategy. See References, links and further resources.

Habitat: The place or type of site in which an organism naturally occurs.","Weeds","","Ecology","5","","Lantana spreads in two ways. Layering is a form of vegetative reproduction where stems send roots into the soil, allowing it to quickly form very dense stands and spread short distances. Also, birds and other animals such as foxes consume and pass the seed in their droppings, potentially spreading it over quite large distances. The germination rate of fresh seed is generally low, but improves after being digested (!CRC 2003).<br/>Butterflies, bees and other insects are attracted by the nectar and pollinate Lantana flowers. About half of the flowers produce seeds, typically 1-20 seeds on each flower head. Mature plants can produce up to 12 000 seeds every year. Seeds are thought to remain viable for several years under natural conditions (!CRC 2003).<br/>Lantana is allelopathic and can release chemicals into the surrounding soil which prevent germination and competition from some other plant species (!CRC 2003).","","","","","","","","","","richtext","","","","","","","PaulAlexander","1278393294","BaseUserMapping_333","1304790521","8","Weeds","88a2120b48dca0d2349a237ee2664cb7"
