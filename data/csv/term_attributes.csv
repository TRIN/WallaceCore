"TaxonProfile/Builder.SameAs","OWL:SameAs","The built-in OWL property owl:sameAs links an individual to an individual. Such an owl:sameAs statement indicates that two URI references actually refer to the same thing: the individuals have the same ""identity"". ","","For individuals such as ""people"" this notion is relatively easy to understand. For example, we could state that the following two URI references actually refer to the same person:\r\n\r\n<rdf:Description rdf:about=""#William_Jefferson_Clinton"">\r\n  <owl:sameAs rdf:resource=""#BillClinton""/>\r\n</rdf:Description>\r\n\r\nThe owl:sameAs statements are often used in defining mappings between ontologies. It is unrealistic to assume everybody will use the same name to refer to individuals. That would require some grand design, which is contrary to the spirit of the web. ","http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-ref/#sameAs-def","","In OWL Full, where a class can be treated as instances of (meta)classes, we can use the owl:sameAs construct to define class equality, thus indicating that two concepts have the same intensional meaning. An example:\r\n\r\n<owl:Class rdf:ID=""FootballTeam"">\r\n  <owl:sameAs rdf:resource=""http://sports.org/US#SoccerTeam""/>\r\n</owl:Class>\r\n\r\nOne could imagine this axiom to be part of a European sports ontology. The two classes are treated here as individuals, in this case as instances of the class owl:Class. This allows us to state that the class FootballTeam in some European sports ontology denotes the same concept as the class SoccerTeam in some American sports ontology. Note the difference with the statement:\r\n\r\n<footballTeam owl:equivalentClass us:soccerTeam />\r\n\r\nwhich states that the two classes have the same class extension, but are not (necessarily) the same concepts.
